# Saber Accounting MVP

Saber Accounting is a Windows desktop accounting application with a central shared database for three users. This first version includes:

- English, Arabic, and French interface
- Automatic USD, EUR, LBP, and AED detection from currency and amount cells
- Missing currency defaults to USD; conflicting or unsupported currencies are flagged for review
- Currency filter for the dashboard, invoices, trial balance, and exported reports
- Lebanese VAT at 11%
- Purchase and sales invoice import from Excel
- Manual purchase and sales invoice entry with multiple items
- Automatic 11% VAT per item, with editable VAT rate and VAT amount
- Editable total before VAT per item with automatic invoice totals
- Original invoice number when supplied; otherwise original Excel row number
- Completely empty rows skipped; duplicate invoices retained
- Automatic double-entry journal posting
- Invoice register, dashboard, and trial balance
- User authentication, roles, audit log, customer/supplier, inventory, and stock database foundations

## Important status

This is an MVP for controlled testing. Before production use, add HTTPS, automatic encrypted backups, user-management screens, sequential journal controls, complete inventory valuation, period locking, exchange-rate revaluation, invoice editing/reversal workflows, and Lebanese tax-report validation by the firm's accountant.

## Quick start on one computer

Install Python 3.11 or newer. Open Command Prompt in this folder and run:

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_server.py --admin-password YourStrongPassword
```

Open a second Command Prompt in the same folder:

```bat
python run_desktop.py
```

Sign in with username `admin`, your chosen server password, and server address `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

## Three synchronized computers

1. Choose one always-on office computer or Windows server to host the shared database.
2. Give that computer a fixed local IP address.
3. Allow TCP port `8765` only on the trusted office network.
4. Run `run_server.py` only on the server computer.
5. Run the desktop client on each of the three computers.
6. Enter `http://SERVER-IP:8765` on the sign-in screen.

For access outside the office, do not expose port 8765 directly to the internet. Use a professionally configured HTTPS reverse proxy or VPN.

## Excel import rules

The first worksheet is imported. Recognized English, Arabic, and French headings include Invoice Number, Date, Supplier/Customer Name, Total Before VAT, VAT, Total After VAT, Currency, and Type.

- If an invoice-number column contains a value, that value is used.
- Otherwise the original Excel row number is used. Excel row 24 becomes invoice 24.
- Completely empty rows are ignored.
- Duplicate invoices are deliberately retained.
- The original filename and Excel row number are stored for audit tracking.
- Missing VAT is calculated at 11% when the subtotal exists.
- Existing VAT values are preserved, even when they differ from 11%.
- Source totals that do not equal subtotal plus VAT are preserved, marked `review`, and posted against Import Variance so the ledger remains balanced.

## Build the Windows executable

On Windows, after installing the requirements:

```bat
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --name SaberAccounting run_desktop.py
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --name SaberAccountingServer run_server.py
```

The executables will be created in the `dist` folder. No GitHub account is required.

## Build a one-click installer online

Upload this project to a private GitHub repository. The included workflow runs the tests, creates the standalone client and server, and packages them as `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`. Open the repository's Actions tab, select **Build Saber Accounting Installer**, run the workflow, and download the **SaberAccountingSetup** artifact. End users do not need Python or GitHub.
