# Saber Accounting MVP

Saber Accounting is a Windows desktop accounting application with a central shared database for three users. This first version includes:

- English, Arabic, and French interface
- Automatic USD, EUR, LBP, and AED detection from currency and amount cells
- Missing currency defaults to USD; conflicting or unsupported currencies are flagged for review
- Currency filter for the dashboard, invoices, trial balance, and exported reports
- Lebanese VAT at 11%
- Purchase and sales invoice import from Excel
- Manual purchase and sales invoice entry with multiple items
- Automatic 11% VAT per item, with editable VAT rate and VAT amount
- Editable total before VAT per item with automatic invoice totals
- Original invoice number when supplied; otherwise original Excel row number
- Completely empty rows skipped; duplicate invoices retained
- Automatic double-entry journal posting
- Invoice register, dashboard, and trial balance
- User authentication, roles, audit log, customer/supplier, inventory, and stock database foundations

## Important status

This is an MVP for controlled testing. Before production use, add HTTPS, automatic encrypted backups, user-management screens, sequential journal controls, complete inventory valuation, period locking, exchange-rate revaluation, invoice editing/reversal workflows, and Lebanese tax-report validation by the firm's accountant.

## Quick start on one computer

Install Python 3.11 or newer. Open Command Prompt in this folder and run:

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_server.py --admin-password YourStrongPassword
```

Open a second Command Prompt in the same folder:

```bat
python run_desktop.py
```

Sign in with username `admin`, your chosen server password, and server address `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

## Three synchronized computers

1. Choose one always-on office computer or Windows server to host the shared database.
2. Give that computer a fixed local IP address.
3. Allow TCP port `8765` only on the trusted office network.
4. Run `run_server.py` only on the server computer.
5. Run the desktop client on each of the three computers.
6. Enter `http://SERVER-IP:8765` on the sign-in screen.

For access outside the office, do not expose port 8765 directly to the internet. Use a professionally configured HTTPS reverse proxy or VPN.

## Excel import rules

The first worksheet is imported. Recognized English, Arabic, and French headings include Invoice Number, Date, Supplier/Customer Name, Total Before VAT, VAT, Total After VAT, Currency, and Type.

- If an invoice-number column contains a value, that value is used.
- Otherwise the original Excel row number is used. Excel row 24 becomes invoice 24.
- Completely empty rows are ignored.
- Duplicate invoices are deliberately retained.
- The original filename and Excel row number are stored for audit tracking.
- Missing VAT is calculated at 11% when the subtotal exists.
- Existing VAT values are preserved, even when they differ from 11%.
- Source totals that do not equal subtotal plus VAT are preserved, marked `review`, and posted against Import Variance so the ledger remains balanced.

## Build the Windows executable

On Windows, after installing the requirements:

```bat
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --name SaberAccounting run_desktop.py
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --name SaberAccountingServer run_server.py
```

The executables will be created in the `dist` folder. No GitHub account is required.

## Build a one-click installer online

Upload this project to a private GitHub repository. The included workflow runs the tests, creates the standalone client and server, and packages them as `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`. Open the repository's Actions tab, select **Build Saber Accounting Installer**, run the workflow, and download the **SaberAccountingSetup** artifact. End users do not need Python or GitHub.

## Version 0.7.1 fresh start

The default server database is `SaberAccounting/saber_accounting_v0_7.db`. This gives the upgraded application a completely fresh company file with only the default admin account. The previous `saber_accounting.db` is not loaded and remains available as a safety archive. New entries in v0.7.1 persist normally after the application is closed and reopened.

## Version 0.7.2 Excel currency formats

Excel imports detect USD, EUR, LBP, and AED from both cell contents and Excel Accounting/Custom number formats. This supports sheets where currency symbols are displayed beside numeric values without a separate Currency column. Imported dashboards, invoice lists, trial balances, and exports remain separated by currency.

## Version 0.7.3 currency page filter

The Import Excel preview includes an All/USD/EUR/LBP/AED selector and Apply button. Only rows assigned to the selected currency are displayed. Blank cells with leftover number formatting are ignored during detection; genuinely mixed rows are assigned using Total, Before VAT, and VAT evidence and remain flagged for review.

## Version 1.12.0 final release

### Payroll official reports (Payroll > Official Reports)
- **R10** quarterly salary tax withholding, **R5** annual employer declaration, **R6** individual annual statement.
- Any **month, quarter or year**; employees and managers in **separate sections**, plus a grand total.
- NSSF **employee 3%** and employer medical, family and end-of-service contributions.
- Rates and ceilings are **effective-dated (Date From to Date To)**: each month uses the rules in force on its own date. Saving a new Date From automatically ends the previous period the day before; overlapping periods are rejected.
- Separate columns for **retro salary (with its own retro tax)**, transport, schooling, bonus and 13th salary. R6 shows each retro period.
- Official amounts in LBP (other currencies converted at the payroll month's rate). Posted payroll only, with an optional draft preview.
- **Excel and PDF** export.

### Quarterly VAT (Quarterly VAT tab)
- **Q1-Q4** dates set automatically.
- Sales (output) VAT; deductible VAT on purchases, fixed assets, expenses and customs/imports; **non-deductible VAT** shown separately.
- VAT **payable or credit** carried forward to the next quarter (including into Q1 from the previous fiscal-year file).
- Totals **by currency with LBP equivalents**.
- **Manual adjustments** with a mandatory reason. Saving a return locks the quarter; only an administrator can reopen it.
- Marking VAT non-deductible (Uploaded Data > "VAT Deductible / Non-Deductible", or the expense checkbox) moves that VAT into cost, so the ledger always equals the return.
- **Excel and PDF** export.

### Security and polish
- New non-admin users are valid for **1 year** ("Renew 1 Year" in Security > Users). Expired users cannot sign in. Sessions end after 24 hours.
- Per-user **Payroll** and **VAT** access. At least one active administrator is always kept.
- **Legal document alerts** at sign-in and from the header button, for expired documents and documents expiring within 30 days.
- Backups use SQLite's online backup (safe while others work). Restore validates the file and creates a safety backup first.
- Clearer error messages. A page that fails to load no longer stops the others.

### Fixes
- Payroll saved from the desktop app now stores the period correctly (this previously affected payroll numbering and rate lookups).
- Exchange-rate lookups now pick the latest rate on or before the date, chronologically.
- Users created in Settings are saved to the sign-in database.

### To confirm with your accountant
The salary tax method is unchanged: transport and schooling are included in taxable salary, and one-off bonus / 13th salary are annualized ×12 in the month paid. Adjust in Tax & NSSF Settings or ask for a rule change if your practice differs.

### Build the installer (final workflow)
1. Upload this project to the GitHub repository (replace the old files).
2. Open **Actions**, select **Build Saber Accounting Installer**, click **Run workflow**. It also runs automatically on every push to `main`.
3. When it finishes, download the **SaberAccountingSetup** artifact and run `SaberAccountingSetup.exe`.

One installer only: no Python, no manual server. The data service starts automatically inside the app, and company data stays in the user's `SaberAccounting` folder across upgrades. First sign-in on a new computer: `admin` / `admin` (change it in Security > Users).

## Inventory (Lebanese periodic method)
- Purchases stay in 601. Stock quantities and costs come from the stock documents.
- Costing: weighted average (default) or FIFO. Stock can never go negative in a warehouse.
- A Sales Invoice line with an Item code issues the stock automatically (Stock Issue linked to the invoice; deleting or cancelling the invoice removes it).
- Reports: Stock Valuation (at any date, by warehouse, at cost and at sales price), Stock Card, Stock Movements, Sales Margin (COGS), Reorder, Slow-moving stock. Excel, PDF and print.
- Year end: the Stock Variation voucher (type 06) cancels account 37 against 6051 and books the closing stock (Dr 37 / Cr 6052). It is posted automatically when the year is closed, and the closing stock becomes the Opening Stock of the next year.

## Year-end order
1. Enter the last documents of the year and check the stock (Inventory > Reports > Stock Valuation at 31-12).
2. Profit & Loss > Preview Closing 6&7.
3. Close the year: stock variation, closing 6 & 7 (result to 121 / 125), and the opening of the next year (balances and stock) are made automatically.
4. "Delete Closing & Reopen Year" undoes everything if a correction is needed.

## Points to confirm with the accountant
- Employer NSSF sickness & maternity rate (8% per PwC; one source says 11%).
- Exact start dates of Jan-Feb 2024 ceilings and the 28M minimum wage.
- VAT declaration box numbers against the official MoF form; rounding of the deduction ratio.

# Version 2.1.0

## Arabic in PDF
Every PDF (reports, statements, invoices, VAT declaration, R5 / R6 / R10, NSSF statement) prints Arabic text correctly - joined letters, right-to-left - using the Amiri font (SIL Open Font License, `assets/fonts/Amiri-OFL.txt`). Official reports carry Arabic labels next to the English.

## NSSF ceilings - automatic and monthly
- A new or never-configured company loads the Lebanese periods 2024-2026 automatically (ceilings, rates, family allowances, tax rounding). Settings you changed yourself are never overwritten; "Load Lebanese Law 2024-2026" reloads them on request.
- Payroll is monthly: each payroll uses the rules in force on the **last day of its month** (for example the 90M -> 120M ceiling change of August 2025, or the LBP 10,000 rounding from 25-11-2024 for November). Retroactive pay uses the ceilings of each of its own months.
- Payroll > Official Reports > "CEILINGS - NSSF ceilings by month" shows the ceilings and rates of every month of a year.

## NSSF payment format
Payroll > Official Reports > "NSSF - Contributions statement (payment)", monthly or quarterly, Arabic / English:
- per employee and month: NSSF number, salary subject, capped bases and contributions for sickness & maternity (employee 3% + employer), family allowances (6%) and end of service (8.5%), family allowances already paid, net due;
- payment summary by branch and the net amount payable to the NSSF (LBP);
- the monthly ceilings and rates applied; employer NSSF number from General Settings.
"Record NSSF Payment" books the payment voucher (Dr NSSF payable / Cr cash or bank).

## Fix
Company files created by older versions are brought up to date automatically when they are opened.

# Version 2.2.0

## Sales Invoice, Debit Note, Credit Note
- Document type: Invoice (SAL-), Debit Note (DN-), Credit Note (CN-, reverses the sale and reduces the VAT of the period).
- Lines: Item, Description, Qty, Unit, Unit Price, Total Amount, Discount %, VAT %, Net.
- Totals: Total, Discount (% or amount), **Total HT**, VAT 11% (struck through for zero-rated / exempt), TOTAL, and the **amount in words** in English and Arabic (tafqeet).

## General Journal
Find by voucher number and by details; Print Preview, PDF and Print.

## Payment & Receipt
Cash / bank accounts from 511, 512, 519 and 53 only; customers and suppliers in both tabs; **allocation** of each receipt / payment to open invoices (auto: oldest first), open balance per document.

## Purchases & Expenses
- Find instead of the lists. Purchases: items received into stock with warehouse (F2 item search; an item that does not exist is created automatically), Excel import with template, PDF.
- Cost on purchase: each cost to its own 9-digit 6018 account (601800001 freight, 601800002 insurance, 601800003 customs duties, 601800004 broker, 601800005 other); import VAT to 44210.
- Expense account chosen from accounts 626 to 69.

## Accounts
VAT: 44210 purchases, 44211 export-related purchases, 44216 expenses, 4427 sales. Payroll: 6311 salaries, 6312 bonus / 13th, 6313 commission, 6315 schooling, 6316 managers' salaries, 6319 transport, 4411 salary tax, 4431 NSSF.
Year-end result to **138** (profit) / **139** (loss); the closing voucher is "CLOSING 6&7" in the General Journal.

## Inventory
Items with cost price (average of purchases), supplier, category / subcategory, unit and location. New tabs: Categories & Units, Stock In / Stock Out (at average cost), Physical Inventory (stock on hand, count, difference, save, print, Excel sheet, upload, post the differences). Reports filter by category, subcategory, unit, supplier and warehouse together.

## F2
F2 opens the list that fits the field: items in item fields, customers / suppliers in party fields, accounts elsewhere.

# Version 2.3.0 - Statement of Account / Trial Balance
- Account From / To: search by number or name among all accounts (parents too); the account name shows beside each box (like BRAINS). "Same as From" copies the account.
- The options are in their own "Options" tab; every Show opens its own full-page tab with Print Preview, Print, Excel, PDF and Close Tab. Several statements can stay open side by side.
- Double-click a statement line to see the transaction (all its lines) and "Open in its screen" (journal voucher, sales invoice, purchase, receipt / payment, expense). In the Trial Balance, double-click an account to open its statement in a new tab.

# Version 2.4.0
- Profit & Loss > "Delete Year" (administrators): deletes the last fiscal year of a company (for example 2025, to redo the opening). A backup copy of the file is kept in `companies/<company>/deleted_years`, and the previous year is reopened with its closing removed. Type "DELETE <year>" to confirm. Then close the previous year again to make a new opening.
- NSSF statement: sickness & maternity shown as employee 3% + employer 8% = total 11% (as in the NSSF declaration).

# Version 2.5.0 - Backups per company and per year
- Backups are made automatically each day while signed in to Windows. You can also press "Create Backup Now"; safety backups are made before restore and replacement imports.
- Each company and each fiscal year has its own folder and file name: `SaberAccounting\backups\<Company>\<Year>\<Company>_<Year>_<date>_<time>.db`.
- Security / Backup / Rates > Backup & Restore shows the backups of the company and year you are in, with "Save Backup As..." (copy to a USB key or a drive folder) and "Open Backup Folder". Backups made by older versions still appear and can be restored.

# Data safety and automatic backups update

- The first standalone launch asks you to set an admin password. Existing installations keep their current password.
- Any signed-in user can create, view, and save a backup of the selected company/year from **My Backups**. Only administrators can restore a backup.
- The Windows installer installs a background backup process in the shared Startup folder. It runs after Windows sign-in, checks once per hour, and creates one backup per company/year when 24 hours have passed. The desktop window does not need to be open. The computer must be on and a Windows user must be signed in. On the first new-company launch, a backup is made immediately. Backup files live in `SaberAccounting/backups/<Company>/<Year>` under that Windows user's profile; copy this folder to another drive if you need protection from drive failure.
- Replacing imported invoices now validates the complete batch before changing the live file and keeps manual journal vouchers. If any row fails, the replacement is cancelled. A safety backup is made before a successful replacement.
- Replacement is refused when payments, stock documents, or a saved VAT return are linked to existing invoices, when a fiscal year is closed, or when existing invoices record amounts paid. Review those records first.
- Invalid company/year selections return an error. Payment and expense edits are prepared on a database snapshot before replacing the live file. Stock checks no longer temporarily remove saved movements.
- The PDF import preview scans every page and creates separate preview rows when invoice numbers change. Repeated invoice numbers on following pages are grouped. Scanned pages stay visible for manual entry. Invoices sharing one page still require manual separation and review.
